Deep Neural Network Classification of Reverberant Environments with AudioSet

A simple CNN for acoustic scene classification, using MFCCs to identify 7 different acoustic categories labeled in https://research.google.com/audioset/

This was my first dive into deep neural networks, and a project for Dr. Bei Xiao's deep learning and image processing course at American University.
